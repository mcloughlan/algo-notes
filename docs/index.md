!!! warning New study design

	I removed the outdated content from before 2023 (the old study design), but there may be implicit references to it in other current content


!!! note

    that these notes no not contain everything on the exam. My reccomendation is to read over the current study design. That is what is can be on the exam. This is just what I wanted to write notes for, which is probably > 80% of exam material anyway. I'm not sure.
