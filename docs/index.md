# Welcome to VCE Algorithmics notes

## Introduction

Pull requests are welcome! Please see [the repository](https://github.com/mcloughlan/algo-notes)

If you are studying some non-VCE type of 'algorithms and analysis' this site will still be helpful, but keep in mind that the bulk of this website is designed for VCE students.

!!! note

    that these notes no not contain everything on the exam. My reccomendation is to read over the current study design. That is what is can be on the exam. This is just what I wanted to write notes for, which is probably > 80% of exam material anyway. I'm not sure.
    
    **This is also not an exhaustive list of everything you need to know**. Think of it more as an atlas than course notes. There are a lot of details in here that are not explicitly needed for the exam.
